- 👋 Hi, I’m @gfnorwood
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time to improve my development skills.  It's currently a personal pursuit.  
- Some of the more interesting functional areas include driving into AI/ML, specifically as it relates to financial data and projections.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python.  There appears to be a lot I can do with that platform.  
- The most recent steps include some deep learning in Pandas and MatPlotLib.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational opportunities at this point.  That can and will likely change.  
- My next major areas will likely be with others who are doing this kind of work.
