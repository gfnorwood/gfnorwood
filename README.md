- 👋 Hi, I’m @gfnorwood
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time to improve my development skills.  It's currently a personal pursuit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python.  There appears to be a lot I can do with that platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational opportunities at this point.  That can and will likely change.
